## Cinema Room Manager
Cinema Room Manager project at JetBrains Academy/Hyperskill

## General Info
One of the first self-created applications aimed at managing the cinema room.<br />
A simple application menu allows you to:
* Creation and graphic presentation (in the console) of the cinema room;
* Buying a ticket
* Presentation of cinema room statistics.

I added to the application, which passed all tests on the HyperSkill website, exception handling for inputs and the state of the cinema hall before the possibility of buying a ticket, and much more.<br />
Everything shows that the application shold work properly :)
